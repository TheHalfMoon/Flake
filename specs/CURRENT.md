# CURRENT — Flake v1 Execution Frontier

**Purpose:** one authoritative pointer for what repository work may happen now.

> This file is operational state, not historical evidence. Live GitHub truth and the canonical build plan control execution.

## Authority

The sole implementation roadmap is `docs/canonical/FLAKE_CANONICAL_BUILD_PLAN.md`.
`docs/canonical/FLAKE_MUSE_EXECUTION_HANDOFF.md` is the short execution entry point.

Historical Fehrest, Phase T, R1, and Spec 002 artifacts remain immutable evidence. They are not the active product roadmap and must not be rewritten to make their historical identifiers match later GitHub history.

The historical local-only planning SHAs `4246f6d...` and `852e44b...` are provenance references only. Execution does not require those Git objects or any OneDrive/local path; `docs/evidence/flake-v1/T00-01/REPORT.md` records exactly how a pre-existing local branch carrying those identifiers was reconciled (not adopted as-is) against live GitHub truth.

## Next action

`T01-02` — create an independently specified format-2 transaction store (`canonical.sqlite`), reusing the already-admitted `rusqlite`/`libsqlite3-sys` dependency per `specs/002-post-r1-canonical-core-convergence/corrective-t01/dependency-admission.md` and plan section 34.

Do not activate Spec 003 automatically. Do not invent a replacement roadmap. Do not use OpenAI API or a required paid AI/model service.
